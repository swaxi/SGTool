# Uncomment the following line and add your changelog:
changelog=0.2.18   
      * Fix (again) clipping of csv worms   
      * Fix bug in Filling FFT NaNs in NS direction (Thanks Feargal!)   
    0.2.17    
      * Fix bug saving grid boundary filename
      * Add ArcPro Toolbox support (very Beta!!)   
      * Remove all QGIS library calls from calc engines   
      * Fix bug in worms spatial filtering   
      * Force processed ers output files to have tif suffix   
      * Check for recognised CRS before processing    
    0.2.16
      * Add Euler Deconvolution derived from https://github.com/ffigura/Euler-deconvolution-python
      * Add Noddy grid (grv & mag) import
    0.2.15 Use cosine rolloff for high/low and bandpass filters to reduce ringing
      * Change Remove Regional to 1st or 2nd order polynomial
      * New grids use stdev scaling of grid to better highlight features
    0.2.14 Don't try to load LINE_ID or LINE codes if they don't exist in WTMM
      * added PCA & ICA calculations for multiband grids
      * Speed up Grass-like relief calc
      * added DAT format points import based on ASEG-GDF2 standard (tested against example datasets only)
      * TA demoted to needing RTP_E first in GUI
      * save all CSV/XYZ/DAT imports as shapefiles
      * fix import matplotlib bug and test for LINE_ID for points in WTMM code
    0.2.13 Remove scikit-image functions as they are hard to install on macos 
    0.2.12 Fix loading of RGB tiffs on Linux
      * warn instead of autoload of libraries
      * refactor rte so it works like other FFT
      * recalc buffers so they are factors of powers of 2, 3 or 5 (should make large grid calcs faster)
      * added tooltips to explain dotpoint
      * added plugins.xml to allow direct access via plugin manager
      * added 1D circular windowed spatial stats functions
      * added DTM curvature classifier
      * added Butterworth filter and scaler to DC filter
      * added Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima calcs extracted from grids or for XYZ data (beta!!)
      * fix azimuth direction for relief shading
      * replace bicubic spline dialog with multilevel bicubic spline dialog (from sagang)
      * remove +1x -1y offset from Gaussian filter output
    0.2.11 Remove path insertion in worms code
      * add relief shading option (based on Grass algorithm)
      * generalise a bit epsg parsing for GRD
      * remove degree test for DirCos filter
      * Fix problem with toWkt() on Linux and maybe macs
      * Improved connectivity of worm polylines
      * Another attempt to fix RTP
      * Fix missing buffer for THG calc
      * Another attempt to fix RTE
      * Delete xml file when updating a grid
      * Autocheck boxes when parameter changed
    0.2.10 Bug fixes and GUI Update
      * GUI now split over 5 tabs
      * Add tool to produce outline polygon from a grid
      * Improved null handling in Normalise Grids tool
      * Remove unused joblib import
    0.2.9 Docked widget now adds in tabified mode if another widget already there
      * Reformulated RTP & RTE codes
      * Add grid outline tool
      * Add extra Utils tab to declutter GUI (for now!)
    0.2.8 Added Threshold to NaN tool
      * New conversion of worms to polyline shapefile option
      * New grid normalisation tool
      * New threshold to NaN tool      
      * Sun shading for 90 zenith reset to 88 as this can blow up otherwise
      * Better handling of irregular grids by using linear infill of NaNs
      * Checkboxes labels defined directly
      * GUI rearranged so gradient tools all together
      * Vertical Integration now uses user-defined buffer
    0.2.7 Add worming and improve installation of plugin on PC & Mac
